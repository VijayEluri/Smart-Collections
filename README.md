# Smart Collections

**Smart Collections** is a set of decorators for the standard java collection types. They add some functionality
to the collections and are absolutely compatible to the standard collection types.

## Current Version

The current version is 1.0.0. To use it with Maven, download the jar-File and execute the following
command from the command line:

mvn install:install-file -Dfile=<path-to-file> -DgroupId=com.stefanmuenchow \
    -DartifactId=collections -Dversion=1.0 -Dpackaging=jar

I will add the jar to the central Maven repository soon.
